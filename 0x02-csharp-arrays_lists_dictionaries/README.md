# 0x02. C# - Data Structures: Arrays, Lists, Dictionaries
## Resources :books:
### Read or watch:

* [Arrays (C# Programming Guide)]()
* [How to program in C# - Arrays]()
* [Collections (Skip “Using LINQ to Access a Collection” and “Defining a Custom Collection”)]()
* [C# Lists]()
* [Array vs. List: When to use which?]()
* [C# Dictionaries]()
* [Working with Hashtable and Dictionary in C#]()
* [foreach, in]()
* [List Class]()
* [Dictionary Class]()
* [C# Language Reference]()
* [C# Coding Conventions]()
## Learning Objectives :bulb:
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* How to create and use arrays
* What are Collections in C#
* How to create and use lists
* What is the difference between arrays and lists in C#
* When would you use an array vs a list
* How to create and use dictionaries
* What is the difference between dictionary and hashtables in C#
* When would you use a dictionary vs a hashtable
* How to use foreach
## Requirements :white_check_mark:
* C# Tasks
* Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
* You do not need to know about namespaces yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project
* Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
* You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
* In the following examples, the main.cs files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.cs files at compilation. Our main.cs files might be different from the one shown in the examples
